##npm-scaffold

Quickly create scaffolding for npm modules in the style I prefer (including tests!).


##Quick Start
To create a new module linked to (my) npm + git accounts:

```
npm i -g @jag82/npm-scaffold

npm-scaffold myModule
```

Tests should run and pass immediately!


##TODO:
Pass in account names instead of hardcoding?
